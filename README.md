This is program written in python that acts as a DDNS client, currently just for Cloudflare. Planning for Hurricane Electric and DNSimple.
Works on Python3.6 and up.  

## Python Install

The recommended way is to use pip to install it.  
There is a package available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/Python-DDNS/).

```bash
pip install python-ddns
# Setups the config file to the right name
pddns -i

# Modify config.conf with the require fields.

# To check configuration
pddns -t

# Recommended to test to make sure everything works
pddns

# Edit crontab to run script
crontab -e
# Add
0 * * * * <path/to/pddns> >/dev/null 2>&1 #Updates every hour.
```

## Source Install

Source install if you would rather install it that way.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/python-ddns
cd python-ddns/
python setup.py install

# Setups the config file to the right name
pddns -i

# Modify config.conf with the require fields.

# To check configuration
pddns -t

# Recommended to test to make sure everything works
pddns

# Edit crontab to run script
crontab -e
# Add
0 * * * * <path/to/pddns> >/dev/null 2>&1 # Updates every hour.
```

### TODO

- Easier config editing
- Better service functionality
- Other DNS systems supported
- IPv6 support
